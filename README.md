The CITES Trade Database is a comprehensive database of millions of records spanning decades, that provide insight into a unique international market of trading of endangered species. In this thesis I present a working prototype of a dashboard that can provide a new exploratory technique based on volume and spatio-temporal visualization of relationships between importer and exporter countries as trade connections on a map view. The dashboard is able to visualize terms, source and purpose of the trade connections by utilizing a multi-view of attributes in the Trade Database. The design and data process are described in detail, as is the process of basing developing on feedback from a domain expert. The resulting functionality is showcased as case presentations of a selection of species.

As this is the product of a master thesis, no future development will be made on this repo.
